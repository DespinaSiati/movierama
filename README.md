MovieRama is a mobile-friendly web application that allows users to browse through all the movies currently in theaters (home.html - In Theaters in the menu), as well as to search the movies of their liking (search.html - Search in the menu).

When in home page, the users can see all the movies in theaters, their title, year of release, poster, genres and overview. If they want to learn more about the movie, they can press the "Read more" button. That's when the box containing the movie expands and shows the movie trailer, reviews and related films. If one or more of these is missing, Movierama shows an appropriate message. By clicking on "Read less", the box goes back to its original state. Lastly, the users have the ability to infinitely scroll, as 20 new movies appear when they reach the bottom of the page.

When in search page, the users can search for any movie. As they type, the results start coming up. The movies are shown the same way as they do in the home page and the infinate scrolling works in a similar manner.

The Movierama application is responsive for smaller devices
